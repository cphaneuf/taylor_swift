# Machine Learning Analysis of Taylor Swift Lyrics

This repo includes my final project for the Psy2085 course at Harvard University during Fall 2023. The class was lead by Patrick Mair, PhD and assistant-taught by Daniel Low. During the course, students applied machine learning techniques to datasets of their choice. As a Swiftie, I looked to use my new-found skills on Taylor Swift lyrics. With these skills, I aimed to better understand how her music has changed over time.

<b><i>To summarize the contents of this repo:</b></i>

<b><i>TSLyricsInputs</b></i> contains txt files of Taylor Swift lyrics (sorted into albums) and png files of each Taylor Swift album cover

<b><i>TSLyricsOutputs</b></i> contains png files of visualizations created with the Python code and pickle dump files of time-intensive models in the code

<b><i>TSLyricsScripts</b></i> contains the Python code* and yaml file (to recreate my environment in the Anaconda-Navigator)

*Developed using the Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), launched through Anaconda-Navigator.

Questions can be directed to me: Camille Phaneuf (cphaneuf@g.harvard.edu).
