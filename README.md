# Machine Learning Analysis of Taylor Swift Lyrics

## INTRODUCTION

This repo includes my final project for the Psy2085 course at Harvard University during Fall 2023. The class was lead by Patrick Mair, PhD and assistant-taught by Daniel Low. During the course, students applied machine learning techniques to datasets of their choosing. As a Swiftie, I looked to use my new-found skills on Taylor Swift lyrics. With these skills, I aimed to better understand how her music has changed over time.

## HOUSEKEEPING

<b><i>To summarize the contents of this repo:</b></i>

<b><i>TSLyricsInputs</b></i> contains txt files of Taylor Swift lyrics (sorted into albums) and png files of each Taylor Swift album cover

<b><i>TSLyricsOutputs</b></i> contains png files of visualizations created with the Python code and pickle dump files of time-intensive models in the code

<b><i>TSLyricsScripts</b></i> contains the Python code* and yaml file (to recreate my environment in Anaconda-Navigator)

*Developed using the Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), launched through Anaconda-Navigator. To run, be sure to change the value of <b><i>abs_path</b></i> to reflect the absolute path to this repo on your personal machine.

## METHODS EMPLOYED

This repo spans the following machine learning techniques: 

- visualizations of word frequency (i.e., the word clouds pictured above)
- characterizations of term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)
- characterizations of word embedding outputs, including the use of multidimensional scaling (mds)
- characterizations of topic modeling outputs
- sentiment analyses of valence and emotion

Interpretations of the results of each of these techniques are embedded within the code as blocked comments.
